> [!NOTE]
> This repo is still under construction; the master branch showcases the most recent versions, so stay tuned for updates!
> You can see the most recent version online right [here](https://ctr-cv.github.io/My-Website). This will be moved in the near future, just hosting on Github Pages for now.

> This repo is also an extension to my previous portfolio, [Personal-Portfolio-1](https://github.com/Ctr-cv/Web-Portfolio-1), back in 2023. Check that one out as well!

For maximum readability and efficiency, this simple page is coded in one .html file with built-in CSS and JS. And since we're aiming for maximum efficiency, 90% of code is written by Deepseek-V3-0324. Huge credits to Deepseek as it would've taken me ages to write all of this.
