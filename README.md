> [!NOTE]
> This repo is still under construction, and haven't gone online yet. The master branch showcases the most recent updates, stay tuned for updates!

> This repo is also an extension to my previous portfolio, [Personal-Portfolio-1](https://github.com/Ctr-cv/Web-Portfolio-1), back in 2023. Check that one out as well!

For maximum readability and efficiency, this simple page is coded in one .html file with built-in CSS and JS. And since we're aiming for maximum efficiency, 90% of code is written by Deepseek-V3-0324. Huge credits to them as it would've taken me ages to remember how to write front-end.

Use `git clone` and open in browser to see it in action.
